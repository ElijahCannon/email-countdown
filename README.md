# email-countdown
Nodejs server that streams GIF-encoded data to client and updates timer every second.

To Run:

git clone https://github.com/ElijahCannon/email-countdown.git

cd email-countdown

npm install

npm start

go to localhost:3000/timer

Please help me fix this. It's supposed to stream the GIF Email Timer to the client endlessly, and update every second. 
Do you know why it's not updating?
